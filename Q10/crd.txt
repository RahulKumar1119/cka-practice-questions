Task 1: List Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
Create a list of all cert-manager Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

Save this list to the file ~/resources.yaml.

You must use kubectl's default output format.

Do not explicitly set an output format with flags like -o yaml or -o json.

Task 2: Extract Documentation
Using kubectl, extract the documentation for the subject specification field of the Certificate Custom Resource.

Save this documentation to the file ~/subject.yaml.

You may use any output format that kubectl supports for this part.

Solution Steps

Part 1: List cert-manager CRDs

The first task requires listing the cert-manager CRDs and saving them to a file using kubectl's default output format. The kubectl get command is used for this purpose. 
The CRDs created by cert-manager typically have a name that includes "cert-manager".

kubectl get crd | grep 'cert-manager.io' > ~/resources.yaml

Part 2: Extract Certificate subject field documentation


For the second task, you need to extract the documentation for a specific field within a custom resource. The kubectl explain command is the correct tool for this.

kubectl explain certificate.spec.subject > ~/subject.yaml
