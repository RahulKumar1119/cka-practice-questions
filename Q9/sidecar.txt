The question presents a scenario where a legacy application needs its logs integrated into Kubernetes' logging system. The task is to:

Update an existing Deployment named synergy-deployment.

Add a new co-located container (a "sidecar") named sidecar to the Pod.

The sidecar container should use the busybox:stable image.

The sidecar container must run the command: /bin/sh -c "tail -n+1 -f /var/log/synergy-deployment.log".

Use a Volume mounted at /var/log to make the log file, synergy-deployment.log, accessible to both the main application container and the new sidecar container.

Do not modify the existing container's specification other than what is required to complete the task.

Solution Steps

This task requires you to modify an existing Kubernetes Deployment to add a sidecar container for log streaming. The solution involves two main steps: defining a shared Volume and adding the new container to the Pod's template.

Step 1: Edit the Deployment
You will use kubectl edit deployment synergy-deployment to modify the YAML specification of the existing Deployment. This command opens the Deployment's manifest in your default editor.

Step 2: Add the Shared Volume
Within the Deployment's spec.template.spec, locate the volumes array. If it doesn't exist, create it. Add a new volume definition. A simple emptyDir volume is perfect for this temporary, shared log file.

# ... inside spec.template.spec
  volumes:
  - name: log-volume
    emptyDir: {}

Step 3: Mount the Volume in Both Containers

Now, you need to add a volumeMounts section to the specification of both the original container and the new sidecar container.

    1. For the existing container: Find the containers array, locate the original container (likely named synergy-app), and add the volumeMounts section to it. The mount path should be /var/log.

# ... inside containers array, for the existing container
  volumeMounts:
  - name: log-volume
    mountPath: /var/log

    2. For the new sidecar container: Under the same containers array, add the new container specification. This container should be named sidecar, use the busybox:stable image, and have its own volumeMounts and command sections.

# ... inside containers array, for the new container
- name: sidecar
  image: busybox:stable
  command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "tail -n+1 -f /var/log/synergy-deployment.log"]
  volumeMounts:
  - name: log-volume
    mountPath: /var/log

    3. After editing the manifest, save the changes and exit the editor. kubectl will automatically apply the updates. The Deployment will then create new Pods with the updated configuration.


Final YAML Structure

The final spec.template.spec block of your Deployment's YAML should look similar to this:


# ...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: synergy-app # (example name of the main container)
        image: your-app-image # (existing app image)
        volumeMounts:
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /var/log
      - name: sidecar
        image: busybox:stable
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "tail -n+1 -f /var/log/synergy-deployment.log"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: log-volume
          mountPath: /var/log
      volumes:
      - name: log-volume
        emptyDir: {}
